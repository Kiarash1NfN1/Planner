# 🎯 Your Personal Productivity & Creative Control Center

Your website is a **personalized productivity and life-management platform** designed specifically to support your creative goals, long-term projects, and mental structure. It combines features from planner apps, Trello-style boards, journaling tools, and timeboxing systems into a **custom all-in-one interface** built around how *you* work. The website has the following core components:

---

## 🧠 1. Chunk Manager

Define “chunks” — long-term goals or categories (like `Books`, `Courses`, `Game Projects`, or `Music Albums`) — and assign a time interval (e.g., 1 month, 2 months). Each chunk includes:

- **Name**
- **Start and End Date**
- **List of Sub-tasks**
- **Progress Checklist**
- **Optional Notes or Reflections**

> This allows you to think in **phases**, not just days — ideal for deep work.

---

## 📆 2. Daily Routine Scheduler

Manage daily events, routines, and tasks with flexibility:

- Repeating tasks (daily/weekly)
- Time-blocked tasks (e.g., 2h gamedev from 3–5PM)
- Tagging (`creative`, `study`, `urgent`)
- Rollover tasks (auto-carry over missed tasks)
- Soft deadlines and flex zones

> Designed to be resilient — date nights, exam weeks, and bad days won’t break your rhythm.

---

## 📋 3. Trello-style Kanban Board

Like Trello, but internal to your system:

- Custom columns (`Backlog`, `In Progress`, `Polishing`, `Done`)
- Drag-and-drop task cards
- Notes, deadlines, tags
- Filter by category (`YouTube`, `Music`, `Study`, `Life`)

> Use this for tracking game features, YouTube edits, music tasks, and life errands.

---

## ⏱️ 4. Integrated Time Tracker *(optional module)*

Track work sessions with context:

- Toggle timers (e.g., “Music Production – Start 3:02 PM”)
- Log session duration, chunk, and notes
- Review past time logs per project/category

> Helps you visualize the effort behind every video, song, or chunk goal.

---

## 📈 5. Progress Graphs & Stats

Stay visually motivated:

- Weekly hours per category (gamedev, editing, music, study)
- Progress bars for YouTube videos (dev %, footage %, editing %, upload %)
- Chunk completion tracking (books read, tracks made, sessions completed)

> Clarity fuels momentum.

---

## 📓 6. Journaling & Cryptic Poetry Section

Express yourself daily:

- Markdown or rich text editor
- Searchable with tags
- Mood logs, raw thoughts, dreams, or lyrics
- Daily poetry & metaphors to reflect your mental state

> A safe, poetic, and honest space for processing your reality.

---

## 🔔 7. (Optional) Web App Mode with Notifications

Make it a PWA (Progressive Web App) to enhance usage:

- Push notifications (`Time to record`, `Next study block starting`, etc.)
- Works offline, syncs when online
- Pin to phone or desktop as a native app

> Turn your planner into a mission control app that follows you everywhere.

---
